Source of renewable Energy Explorer with augmented reality for IOS devices

We use Geolocation-based AR uses GPS, compass and other sensors in a user’s mobile phone to provide a 
“heads-up” display of various geolocated points-of-interest.


This project takes advantage of augmented reality AR as a way to see digital information of Renewable Energies 
in the region of user. In our case Mexico. Also shows the KW or MW potentials usefull for decision and inverstion. 
We make a point of interest that integrates wind, solar, and geothermal energy data and this data are deployed 
in friendly Smartphone App that allow users know where are localized in a geospatial scale.

Is important to mention that we rely on the free service that the Layar company provides for 
independent developers.
